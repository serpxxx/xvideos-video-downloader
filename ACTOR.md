## Why XVideos Downloader

XVideos pages can expose multiple assets around the player, which makes generic download tools noisy and unreliable. A simple page scan may return the wrong asset or fail once playback initializes the actual media source dynamically.

XVideos Downloader is built to simplify that browser workflow. Start the video, let the extension detect the supported stream, choose the quality you want, and export the result as MP4 without leaving the page.

## Features

- Detects supported XVideos media from active watch pages
- XVideos-specific video detection using setVideo pattern extraction and HLS manifest parsing
- In-page download button built into the video player
- Lists available quality variants when present
- Right-click context menu for quick downloads
- Exports MP4 files for easier replay and archiving
- Automatic saving into a dedicated XVIDEOS folder
- Multi-domain support for xvideos.com, xvideos.es, and xvideos2.com
- Works on Chrome, Edge, Brave, Opera, Firefox, Whale, and Yandex

## How It Works

1. Install the extension from the latest release.
2. Open XVideos and visit a video page.
3. Start playback so the extension can detect the stream.
4. Open the popup or use the in-page download button.
5. Choose the quality or stream option you want.
6. Download the video as MP4.
7. Save the final file locally.

## Supported Formats

- Input: supported XVideos video sources (low quality, high quality, HLS, FLV)

## Common Use Cases

- Save an XVideos video for later viewing
- Export the available quality as MP4
- Avoid manually tracing source URLs in the player
- Keep local copies for offline playback
- Use the in-page button or right-click menu for a faster download flow

## Troubleshooting

**The extension does not detect the video**
Start playback first and wait for the page to initialize the active source.

**No quality picker appears**
Some pages expose only one usable stream, so only one option may be available.

**The detected source looks wrong**
Refresh the page and retry after playback starts again.

**The download stopped partway through**
Check whether your internet connection dropped during the download.

**The page requires account access**
The extension only works on media you can already open and play in your active browser session.
